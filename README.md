#Reflection:

##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned plenty of tricks using the CSS padding, borders and margins. I learn that everything in the HTML page has an imaginary space around it in which can be manipulated. I learned that by using padding you are able to either create space between the content and the imaginary border. I also learned about creating borders with the border property to style however you like. Finally I learned about the margin property, which creates space in the outside of the box after the border section. This will create space between the content and other objects in the HTML page. Below is a great example from Google DevTools.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that CSS positioning can be very tricky but it allows you to place your content anywhere that you like in the page. I decided to use the float property, which position my content to the far left of the page. I did not find the need of using the CSS positioning properties but I was very well aware of the use of relative, absolute, fixed, etc.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

If found the design process very hard using CSS. Trying to decided what colors and backgrounds can be very tricky. I sometimes felt like my colors or fonts were not complementary to each other. I decided that it is best to start designing from the top of the website to the bottom. CSS was extremely easy to understand but it can become very messy if you are not careful. The most difficult part of my site was creating the Responsive design. I had a difficult time trying to set the desktop version since I started my design with the mobile version first. I constantly had to change fonts, positions, and layouts around because it was not very fluent. However, after so much work I am very proud of my final product. 

**The only part that is bothering me is the loading of the images. How can I make the image load faster without delay**

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that you can format any element in the HTML page and the great part is that you can format multiple elements that are nested within an element. For example, I formatted a p element that was within a Div>nav>ul>li>p. It seems pretty complicated to go through so much trouble just to format a p tag, since I could have just called it a special class and thatâ€™s it.
